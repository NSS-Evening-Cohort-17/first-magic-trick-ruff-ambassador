                <p id="line"><span class="case">R</span>esting on the side of a sloping hill beckons a soft palazzo with warm invitation. Conveniently, there is a parking garage behind this not so little restaurant which leads you to the guest entrance. As I entered the restaurant, I was welcomed by the rousing aroma of Italian cuisine. When I greeted the host and advised of my reservation, I was swiftly taken to the balcony.  The dining was quite lively with large gathering of family and friends enjoying each other company with a heavy feast. On the balcony, the table and chairs sat a bit high which cause bit of hop for a proper seating. The illumination of the Maggiano’s sign streamed out into the atmosphere. Throughout the years, I have enjoyed many dishes at my favorite Italian restaurant. However, this day particular starry evening I wanted challenge my palate. I decided to try Prince Edward Island Mussels paired with Pinot Grigio. Mussels were presented in a basin of tomato and lemon juices. The mussels were tender and soft. The mussel when draped in sauce provided a melody of flavors that were in perfect harmony.</p>

            <p>Tomato-Based Pasta dishes are best served with red wines. Red wines provide balance to tomato sauce's acidicity. Try the Spaghetti and Meatball with a Merlot.</p>
            <p>Light-bodied white wine can bring out the creaminess of a cheese base pasta. Try the Four-Cheese Ravioli with Chardonnay.</p>
            <p>Seadfood dishes go well with medium-body white wines. Try the Pinot Grigio with the Linguine and Clams.</p>
