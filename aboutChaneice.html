            <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>Resting on the side of a sloping hill beckons a soft palazzo with warm invitation. Conveniently, there is a parking garage behind this not so little restaurant which leads you to the guest entrance. As I entered the restaurant, I was welcomed by the rousing aroma of Italian cuisine. When I greeted the host and advised of my reservation, I was swiftly taken to the balcony.  The dining was quite lively with large gathering of family and friends enjoying each other company with a heavy feast. On the balcony, the table and chairs sat a bit high which cause bit of hop for a proper seating. The illumination of the Maggiano’s sign streamed out into the atmosphere. Throughout the years, I have enjoyed many dishes at my favorite Italian restaurant. However, this day particular starry evening I wanted challenge my palate. I decided to try Prince Edward Island Mussels paired with Pinot Grigio. Mussels were presented in a basin of tomato and lemon juices. The mussels were tender and soft. The mussel when draped in sauce provided a melody of flavors that were in perfect harmony.</p>
